title: The Smart Data Project for Urban Modeling
---

The Smart Data project aims to leverage data science to facilitate urban modeling, particularly integrating data from various sources.

### Continous Integration
This project helps address the data challenge in urban modeling field by making the data processing easier with reusable methods and tools. This project envisions data collection as a continuous process, and put special attention to archive historical data and monitor data quality, and adopts a continuous integration approach for data. 

### Harmonized Data Scheme

Define and develop reusable tools that will create a harmonized and coherent land use database from various public and private sources:

* Parcels
* Buildings
* Local Streets
* Travel Model Networks
* Traffic Analysis Zones
* Census Geographies
* Political Boundaries
* Land Use Plans
* Development Projects
* Households
* Businesses
* Terrain

### Data Quality

The data quality indicators provide a gauge of the quality of individual datasets and consistency between different datasets. We plan to automate the data quality indicators following continuous software testing procedures, so that the quality information is available at all time as data sources are being integrated on a continuous basis.

### Open and Reusable

Programs and scripts for this project are developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/cities/smartdata">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.
